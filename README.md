To look for a suitable time for a team to meet has always been a pain, for students and professionals alike. With Project S, we aim to speed up that process by automating the task, cross-matching multiple schedules to find the ideal meeting time. We also hope to solve minor issues such as time zone calculations, attendance tracking, personal scheduling, and more.
